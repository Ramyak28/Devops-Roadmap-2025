## 1. Continuous Development
This stage involves committing code to version control tools such as Git or SVN for maintaining the different versions of the code, and tools like Ant, Maven, Gradle for building/packaging the code into an executable file that can be forwarded to the QAs for testing.
## 2. Continuous Integration
Continuous integration is a DevOps software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository, after which automated builds and tests are run.
## 3. Continuous Deployment
In this stage the code is built, the environment or the application is containerized and is pushed onto the desired server. The key processes in this stage are Configuration Management, Virtualization, and Containerization.
